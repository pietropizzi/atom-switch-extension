# Configuration

Default file extensions: `['.js', '.html', '.css']`
Default keyboard shortcut: `Alt + O`

# Usage

Let's say the you set up the extensions to be `.js`, `.html` and `.css`.

If you then have a `.js` file open and execute the command (default shortcut is `Alt + o`) it will open the `.html` file in the same directory if it exists, otherwise it will try to open the `.css` file.
